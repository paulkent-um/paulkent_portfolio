<p>The remaster of Metroid was done as a partner assignment; I programmed logic for controlling Samus and enemy behaviors. Additionally, I designed and implemented the Sparkshot powerup featured in the custom level. (Press 4 in game to see it!)</p>
<p>Essentially all of the code of Outwards was my own work, using various graphical and audio assets from the Unity Asset Store and from Freesound.org.</p>
<p>The Power of Fire was the result of a five-person collaborative effort of which I was a member. My contributions were mostly technical in nature, including the intro and outro cutscenes, implementing the breakable platforms, fixing bugs, and so forth.
