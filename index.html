	<li><a href="https://eulersapprentice.itch.io/outwards">Outwards</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The remaster of Metroid was done as a partner assignment; I programmed logic for controlling Samus and enemy behaviors. Additionally, I designed and implemented the Sparkshot powerup featured in the custom level. (Press 4 in game to see it!)</p>
<p>Essentially all of the code of Outwards was my own work, using various graphical and audio assets from the Unity Asset Store and from Freesound.org.</p>
